Your back end runs on promises: when an order is placed, an email goes out; when a payment clears, inventory updates. 
In today's complex distributed systems, a lot can go wrong—networks fail, services time out. 
Inngest helps you keep your promises, ensuring your workflows run reliably, even when the unexpected happens.

## The need for asynchronicity
As your architecture grows, workflows spread across many services and APIs. You can't do everything at once—asynchronous workflows become essential to keep systems responsive and scalable. Without clear patterns and the right tools though, asynchronous workloads will inevitably turns messy, like a remote team without the right collaboration tools: work happens, but things fall through the cracks. Async demands discipline and structure to ensure reliability and maintainability. 

### The traditional async way: Queues
Queues are a common solution for managing asynchronous workflows. They allow you to decouple your services, ensuring that tasks can be processed independently and at scale. 
Queues are great for decoupling, but they don't solve everything. They don't guarantee delivery, they don't manage state, and they don't provide a way to control the execution flow of your functions. This is where Inngest comes in.

### Inngest's innovative approach 
Inngest is a [durable execution engine](https://www.inngest.com/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed#what-is-durable-execution) that orchestrates your workflows. It expands the principles of queues by adding crucial features to manage state, control execution flow, and ensure reliability.

* listens for events 
* decides **when** your functions should run 
* sends an HTTP request to your function's endpoint when it's time to run.
* ensures reliability with built-in retries, state, and delivery guarantee 
 


## Inngest key concepts
Inngest event-driven orchestration is built around 3 core elements: [Events](./concepts#events), [Functions](./concepts#functions-jobs), and [Steps](./concepts#steps).

// Diagram of the 3 elements

### Events
Events are the **signals** that **triggers** function execution.  
Originate from: 
* your back end (w/ inngest SDK) 
* cron jobs 
* webhooks 
* other inngest functions

Customizable (filter, batching,...)

<Expandable
title="Event example">
```ts
// This sends an event to Inngest.
await inngest.send({
  name: "storefront/cart.checkout.completed",
  data: {...},
});

### Functions (jobs)
Functions are Inngest's building block. The job to be done. They can be as basic or as complex as you need them to be.
Run on your favorite infra, serverless or anything else 

Fault tolerant: can throw errors or exceptions and automatically retry, resuming execution from the point of failure
stateful:
can persist state across function invocations and retries

Fan-out (parallelize at the function level)

Send events from function
value: 

```ts Function 
export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "activation-email" },
  { event: "app/user.created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
      return await sendEmail({ 
          email: event.user.email, 
          template: "welcome" 
        });
    });
  }
);
```


### Steps
Steps are a unit of work to be completed within your function's flow. They can be thought of as milestones in the functions execution flow.
stateful  
Each step is it's own http request  
Fine-grained control over execution flow  
Steps comes with a wealth of built-in features to control the execution of your functions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Queue" default>
    Executed in the order they're defined, and each step can depend on the output of the previous step. This allows for complex workflows to be built with ease.  
    ![sleep](/images/queue.svg)
    Here's an example of how to send an event to Inngest from a step in your function:
    ```ts 
      // This sends an event to Inngest.
      await inngest.send({
        name: "storefront/cart.checkout.completed",
        data: {...},
      });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sleep">
    Introduce delays in the workflow, allowing for asynchronous operations to complete before moving on to the next step.  
    ![sleep](/images/hero-dark.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Schedule">
    Run at a specific time or interval, allowing for periodic tasks to be executed without manual intervention.  
    ![sleep](/images/checks-passed.png)
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Parallelize">
    Executed in parallel, allowing for tasks to be completed simultaneously, improving efficiency and reducing total execution time.    
    ![sleep](/images/checks-passed.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Retry">
    Retried if they fail, ensuring that the workflow can recover from errors and continue execution.    
    ![sleep](/images/checks-passed.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Replay">
    Replayed, allowing for the workflow to be re-executed from a specific point in the execution flow. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.    
    ![sleep](/images/checks-passed.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Flow control
[TODO] replace AI nonsense filler  
Inngest gives you the ability to control the execution order of your functions and steps within a workflow. It allows you to define how your functions interact with each other, ensuring that they run in the correct sequence and under the right conditions.  
throttle, multi-tenant concurrency, prioritization, rate limiting, batching, and more.

You can use conditional logic, loops, and branching to create complex workflows that adapt to different scenarios. 
prioritize

### Manage/monitor
[TODO] replace AI nonsense filler  
Inngest provides built-in monitoring and observability tools to help you track the execution of your workflows. You can see the status of each function, view logs, and monitor performance metrics. This makes it easy to identify and troubleshoot issues in your workflows.
