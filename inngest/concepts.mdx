Your back end runs on promises: when an order is placed, an email goes out, when a payment clears, inventory updates. But in complex systems promises can be broken, network is unreliable, stuff happens. Inngest makes sure that despite those uncertainties, you'll be able to keep your promises.

## The need for asynchronicity
More complex workflows, more complex and distributed architecture -> need for async.  
Async is great (whyâ€¦)   
Without the right tools and rules async can become a mess, and disorganized. (analogy of distributed/remote work)

### Orchestrating asynchronicity  
The need for discipline & the traditional async way (queues)
Why you need queues solves part of that
Where they fall short Comparison with kafka or rabbitMQ (table format?)

Better than queues, no infra, and better DX

Inngest is a [durable execution engine](https://www.inngest.com/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed#what-is-durable-execution) that orchestrates your workflows: 
* listens for events 
* decides **when** your functions should run 
* sends an HTTP request to your function's endpoint when it's time to run.
* ensures reliability with built-in retries, state, and delivery guarantee 

Inngest helps you build reliable, event-driven workflows without managing complex infrastructure so you can focus on your business logic.

## Inngest core concepts
Inngest event-driven orchestration is built around 3 core elements: [Events](./concepts#events), [Functions](./concepts#functions-jobs), and [Steps](./concepts#steps).

// Diagram of the 3 elements

### Events
Events are the **signals** that **triggers** function execution.  
Originate from: your back end (w/ inngest SDK), cron jobs, webhooks, or even other inngest functions.
Customizable (filter, batching,

```ts
// This sends an event to Inngest.
await inngest.send({
    name: "storefront/cart.checkout.completed",
    data: {...},
});

### Functions (jobs)
Functions are Inngest's building block. The job to be done. They can be as basic or as complex as you need them to be.
Run on your favorite infra, serverless or anything else 

Fault tolerant:can throw errors or exceptions and automatically retry, resuming execution from the point of failure
stateful:
can persist state across function invocations and retries

Fan-out (parallelize at the function level)

Send events from function

### Steps
Steps are a unit of work to be completed within your function's flow. They can be thought of as milestones in the functions execution flow.

State
This is where the magic happens
Each step is it's own http request


Fine-grained control over execution flow
Steps comes with a wealth of built-in features to control the execution flow of your functions:


#### Queue / sequence
Steps are executed in the order they're defined, and each step can depend on the output of the previous step. This allows for complex workflows to be built with ease.



#### Sleep
Steps can be used to introduce delays in the workflow, allowing for asynchronous operations to complete before moving on to the next step.

#### Schedule / cron
Steps can be scheduled to run at a specific time or interval, allowing for periodic tasks to be executed without manual intervention.

#### Parallelise
Steps can be executed in parallel, allowing for tasks to be completed simultaneously, improving efficiency and reducing total execution time.

#### Retry
Steps can be retried if they fail, ensuring that the workflow can recover from errors and continue execution.

#### Replay
Steps can be replayed, allowing for the workflow to be re-executed from a specific point in the execution flow. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.
