### Acknowledgements
- A production ready article would have required more time, with review for technical accuracy. 
- Ideally, user research would have been done prior to writing that article to make sure it meets the needs of the target audience. I went with my own assumptions, which may not be accurate.
- Current diagrams aren't pretty. In real conditions, I would have invested more in making stylish ones, possibly animated. I strongly believe in the power of visuals to make points stick, especially for conceptual articles like this one.
- comparison chart might not be totally accurate, but it felt like a nice summary of the key points.
- some of the links at the end of the article are fake, that's what I think would be useful to link to. 

### Audience
It all starts from the audience!  
- **Article's target audience**: Back end engineers, from indie devs to devs in large engineering teams.  
- **Assumptions about the audience's prior knowledge of Inngest**: close to zero, a tool helping with events.  
- **Audience's goal reading this article**: understand how to use Inngest to build event-driven applications, and to learn about the benefits of using Inngest for such tasks.

### Editorial choices:
- A maxim I like is: Do serious work, without taking yourself too seriously. I generally try to keep a light tone, to keep the reader engaged while still being professional and informative.
- The article's title: **5 minutes to Inngest**, is a pun on the time it takes the reader to "ingest" this article about Inngest. I would totally be ok to work on alternative titles if that doesn't resonate with the brand's vibe.
- We could find alternatives to the brain/subconscious analogy, I aimed for something relatable to everyone and easy to bake into code snippets, without being narrow real app examples. I wanted to keep the article conceptual.


### Stats
- [flesch-kincaid grade-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_grade_level): 8.8   
In general, aiming for around 8. First drafts were more around 15  
- word count: 1572  
I was deliberately aiming for the lower bound of the word count, it's actually harder to be concise than wordy. I wanted to keep the article approachable and focused on the core concepts. For a conceptual article 1500 words personally feels like a lot. In real conditions, I would consider breaking it out into multiple articles, but for this assignment I kept it as a single piece for simplicity. 

### Time spent on the article:
The assignment mentioned under 1 hour, but for a conceptual article covering the whole tech, and given the research needed to craft something useful, it required more time than that.
-	Research: 4 hours
-	Scoping/Outline: 1 hour
-	Drafting (first pass): 3 hours
-	Revisions, Edits: 2 hours
-	Code samples, diagrams: 2 hours
-	Final polish & formatting: 1 hour
-	Total: approx. 13 hours

I was totally fine investing this time in the assignment, just wanted to be transparent about it.



### Tooling
- **Styling/linting**: [Vale](https://vale.sh/) as a text linter, with the following styles:
  - Microsoft writing style guide
  - write-good
- **Mintlify**: I noticed Inngest's doc runs on Mintlify. As writing mdx in the IDE is part of my typical workflow, I decided to use Mintlify too for this assignment, to bring the reading experience as close to what it would look in Inngest's docs.
- **Mermaid for diagrams** (built-in mintlify)
- **AI** AI is part of my workflow, as it should for any content producer.
