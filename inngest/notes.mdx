### Audience
It all starts from the audience!  
I wrote this article for back end engineers—whether indie developers or part of large teams—who are new to Inngest and want to understand its core concepts and benefits for event-driven applications.

### Editorial choices
- A maxim I like is: Do serious work, without taking yourself too seriously. I aim to maintain a light tone to engage the reader while remaining professional and informative.
- The article's title: *5 minutes to Inngest*, is a playful pun that hints at the time it takes to read and *ingest* the content. I would totally be ok to work on alternative titles if that doesn't resonate with the brand's vibe.
- I chose the brain/subconscious analogy for its universal familiarity and ease of mapping to code snippets, rather than tying it to narrow real-world app examples.

### Stats
- [flesch-kincaid grade-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_grade_level): 8.8   
In general, aiming for around 8. First drafts were more around 15  
- word count: ~1600 words  
I was aiming for the lower bound of the 1500 word count, (it's harder to be concise than wordy!). I wanted to keep the article approachable and focused on the core concepts. For a conceptual article 1500 words personally feels like a lot. In real conditions, I would consider breaking it out into multiple articles, but for this assignment I kept it as a single piece for simplicity. 
- time spent: the assignment suggested an hour, but covering a complex and broad topic like this—especially with research and code samples—took me over 10 hours. I was happy to invest the time for a thorough result.

### Acknowledgements
In real conditions:
- better looking diagrams! I kept them very vanilla for times sakes, and because I mainly used mermaid. In real life, a strong style guide for images and diagrams would do wonders. This is something I'd be delighted to work on if I were to join the team. I strongly believe in the power of visuals to make points stick, especially for conceptual articles like this one.
- review process, for technical accuracy. 
- deeper research for comparison chart accuracy.
- more polish for some code example, the rollback one for instance is weak.
- a concept video inserted near the beginning of th article, for folks who prefer watching to reading.  
- Ideally, user research prior to writing that article to make sure it meets the needs of the target audience.

### Tooling
- **Styling/linting**: [Vale](https://vale.sh/) as a text linter, with the following styles:
  - Microsoft writing style guide
  - write-good
- **Mintlify**: I noticed Inngest's doc runs on Mintlify. As writing mdx in the IDE is part of my typical workflow, I decided to use Mintlify too for this assignment, to bring the reading experience as close to what it would look in Inngest's docs.
- **Mermaid for diagrams** (built-in mintlify)
- **AI** AI is part of my workflow (as it should for any modern content producer), but I use it responsibly. to seed some ideas, to help with phrasing/editing alternatives, to generate code snippets, and for easier refactoring when needed. I don't use AI to write whole articles, but rather as a tool to enhance my writing process.

Overall, I approached this assignment as I would a real-world project: prioritizing clarity, audience needs, and a polished developer experience.
